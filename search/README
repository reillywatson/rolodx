
Editing solr configs:

When editing solr configs, always edit the files in rolodx/search/solr/*.
If the files are edited irectly in apache-solr-3.5.0 the changes will
be discarded since running ./startSolrServer.sh will copy/sync the 
configs into apache-solr-3.5.0 before running the server.
